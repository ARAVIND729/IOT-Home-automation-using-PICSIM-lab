🏠 IoT Home Automation System (Simulation-Based)

📘 Overview

This project implements an IoT-based home automation system using Arduino, Blynk IoT, and PicsimLab. The system enables remote monitoring and control of home appliances such as lighting, heater, cooler, and water tank through a real-time dashboard. A CLCD acts as a local display for system status and sensor readings.

🎯 Objectives

Enable remote control of home appliances via IoT

Monitor temperature and water level in real time

Automate actions based on predefined thresholds

Validate logic through simulation before hardware deployment

🧩 Features Implemented

💡 Garden Light Control: LDR-based automatic brightness control

🌡️ Temperature Monitoring: LM35 temperature display on CLCD

❄️ Cooler Control: ON/OFF via Blynk button widget

🔥 Heater Control: ON/OFF via Blynk button widget

⚠️ Threshold Protection: Heater turns OFF above 35 °C with notification

🚰 Water Tank Monitoring: Displays water volume on CLCD

🔁 Inlet/Outlet Valve Control: Controlled via Blynk buttons

📲 IoT Dashboard: Real-time visualization using Blynk widgets

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
